# YouTube Short to YouTube Video Bookmarklet Toggle
[Bookmarklet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet) is a bookmark that lets you execute JavaScript code. This one allows you to toggle between a YouTube Short and a YouTube Video of the Short.

## How to use the bookmarklet?
Add a new favorite in the toolbar. Name it and paste the code starting with ```javascript: (function...)``` into the URL field.

Once on the YouTube Short, click on the created bookmark and it will take you to the YouTube Video of the Short.

## What problem does this bookmarklet solve?
I am frustrated with YouTube Shorts that have no controls for you to go back a couple of seconds or to scrub to the end of the video. Other short content video platforms have this and YouTube's videos have it as well. And, at the time of writing this, Shorts are essentially Videos.

So, this gives you the controls for Shorts until YouTube decides to add this functionality themselves.

_Notes_
All shorts are videos, but not all videos are shorts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDU_Txk06tM does not have a Short equivalent.
https://www.youtube.com/shorts/RQEn17TlLjE has a Video equivalent https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQEn17TlLjE
