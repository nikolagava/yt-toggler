# YouTube Short to YouTube Video Bookmarklet Toggle

[Bookmarklet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet) is a bookmark that lets you execute JavaScript code. This one allows you to toggle between a YouTube Short and a YouTube Video of the Short.

## How to use the bookmarklet?

Add a new favorite in the toolbar. Name it and paste the code from `script.js` starting with ```javascript: (function...)``` into the URL field.

Once on the YouTube Short, click on the created bookmark and it will take you to the YouTube Video of the Short.

## What problem does this bookmarklet solve?

Simply put, I am frustrated with YouTube Shorts controls.

Sometimes there are no controls or controls simply do not work. Also, scrubber (the red bar) may be hidden by a long description or unclickable due to overlapping links.

YouTube is either doing some weird user-subconcious-monkey-brain-engaging-shareholder-driven-enhancement A/B testing lately or less likely YouTube is trying to support every single device in existence, but at a cost of limiting (_read breaking_) user controls.

Other short content video platforms have this figured out and thankfully YouTube's videos have it as well.

## All shorts are videos, but not all videos are shorts.

At the time of writing this, Shorts are essentially Videos.

You can toggle from and to Shorts and their Video representations. However, toggling a Video that is not a Short will not work.
